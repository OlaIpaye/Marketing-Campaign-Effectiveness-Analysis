# Marketing-Campaign-Effectiveness-Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the effectiveness of two marketing campaigns (Campaign A and Campaign B) by examining their Click-Through Rates (CTR). Using statistical techniques, I was able to determine not only if one campaign performed better than the other, but also measure the practical significance of this difference.

## Analysis

- **T-Test Analysis**:
  To evaluate if there was a statistically significant difference in CTR (Click Through Rate) between Campaign A and Campaign B, I performed a t-test. **The t-test results revealed a significant difference in CTRs, supporting the conclusion that one campaign outperformed the other**.

* **Effect Size Calculation with Cohen's d**:
  To understand the practical significance of this difference, I calculated Cohen's d as a measure of effect size. This metric helped determine the real-world impact of the difference in CTRs.

* **Results Summary**:
* **T-Statistic**: -11.59
* **P-Value**: < 0.05 (statistically significant)
* **Cohen's d**: -1.0367 (large effect size)

* **Key Insight**:
  Campaign B was shown to be significantly more effective than Campaign A, with a large effect size indicating a meaningful advantage in driving user engagement. This insight can inform future marketing strategies by highlighting effective practices.

* **Tools Used**:

  - Python: Data manipulation and analysis
  - pandas: Data wrangling
  - scipy: Statistical tests (t-test and Cohen's d)
  - numpy: Numerical calculations
